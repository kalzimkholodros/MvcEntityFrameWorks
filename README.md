# Entity Framework MVC Projects Collection

This repository contains three different ASP.NET MVC projects that demonstrate various implementations and features using Entity Framework. Each project showcases different aspects of web development with .NET.

## Projects Overview

### 1. EntityMVC
The first project in the series that demonstrates basic Entity Framework implementation with ASP.NET MVC. This project serves as a foundation for understanding the integration of Entity Framework in an MVC architecture.

### 2. EntityMVC2
A continuation of the first project with enhanced features and more advanced Entity Framework implementations. This project builds upon the basic concepts and introduces more complex database operations and relationships.

### 3. JwtAuthMVC (EntityMVC3)
The third project in the series focuses on implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in an ASP.NET MVC application with Entity Framework. This project demonstrates secure authentication and authorization practices.
